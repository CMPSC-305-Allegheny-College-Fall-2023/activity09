## Assigned: 2 November 2023

## Due: END OF CLASS

![bases](./graphics/itWorked.png)

Django is a dynamic website server that contains code to manage an SQL internal database. Fortunately, the managing code is able to convert a user's commands into actual SQL commands to apply to its database. In class, we spent time to discuss how to set up boilerplate code for a Django project. If you are interested in learning more about Django then learn more at https://www.djangoproject.com/start/. 

## Project Goals

* To be learn how to look up the steps necessary to implement software projects
* To learn how to communicate these steps using informal writing
* To determine new ways how to use Python programming to manage database system

## Instructions

Please address the TODO's in the file `writing/reflection.md`. You are to submit this work to your GitHub repository at least three (3) times. Please enter all code from class as your deliverable. Your instructor will have more information about this activity. Note: some of your code may require a database. In this case, please feel free to use the included builder file for the CampusDB

## Project Assessment

This is a check mark grade. Your work will be considered complete when you see the green check-mark at the top of page of your GitHub repository.

## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements for this lab assignment by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python3 installed (type `python --version` to check). If you do not have Python installed, please see:

* [Setting Up Python on Windows](https://realpython.com/lessons/python-windows-setup/)
* [Python 3 Installation and Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
* [How to Install Python 3 and Set Up a Local Programming Environment on Windows 10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10)

Then, if you have not done so already, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

* First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
* Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

* Do not forget to use git commands to push your work to the cloud for the instructor to grade your assignment. You can go to your GitHub repository using your browser to verify that your files have been submitted. Please see the TLâ€™s or the instructor if you have any questions about assignment submission.

Students who have questions about this project outside of the lab time are invited
to ask them in the course's Discord channel or during instructor's or TL's office hours.
